# Simple Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is my first JavaScript project â€” a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks.

 Features

- Add, subtract, multiply, divide
- AC (clear all) and Del (delete last digit)
- Responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid
- Clean and simple user interface

 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (Flexbox & Grid layout)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for logic and DOM manipulation

 Learning Goals

- Understanding DOM manipulation
- Handling user events and input
- Writing modular functions for calculator operations
- Using `querySelectorAll`, `forEach`, and event listeners
- Structuring small frontend projects

 Future Improvements

- Keyboard input support (e.g. typing numbers or operators)
- Enhanced error handling (e.g. divide by zero)
- Support for floating point numbers
- Add calculation history

 Purpose

This project helped me practice JavaScript fundamentals and build confidence in web development. It marks the beginning of my journey into frontend and full-stack development.
